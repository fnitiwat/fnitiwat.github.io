### Notes
#### Introduction
- ML-based applications require distinctly new types of software, hardware and engineering system.
- e.g collecting, preprocessing, labeling, reshaping dataset rathen writing code and also deployed in different way e.g.
	- specialize hardware
	- quality assurance method
	- end to end workflow
	
#### Why Now? The Rise of Full Stack Bottlenecks in ML
- **Deployment Concerns**
	- robustness to adversarial influences, spurious factor
	- privacy, security
- **Cost**
	- Resource for training
	- Annotation
	- Latency, Power
- **Accessibility**
	- It should be everyone can use not just PhD-level

#### MLSys: Building a New Conference at the Intersection of Systems + Machine Learning
- MLSys conference

#### Conclusions
- Many things to learn e.g. software, hardware, monitoring.
